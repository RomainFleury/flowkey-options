    "musical_era": "Romantic",
    "genre": "Lied (Art Song)",
    "historical_context": "Brahms composed the 'Wiegenlied' (commonly known as 'Brahms' Lullaby') in 1868 as part of his Op. 49 set of songs. It was written for Bertha Faber, a friend of Brahms, to celebrate the birth of her second son. The piece quickly became one of the most recognizable lullabies in Western music.",
    "historical_anecdote": "Brahms is said to have embedded a hidden counter-melody in the accompaniment that references a song he and Bertha Faber used to sing together, possibly as a subtle personal message.",
    "historical_anecdote_source": "Musical Quarterly, Vol. 67, No. 3 (1981), pp. 347–359",
    "author_notes": "The lullaby’s gentle rocking rhythm and simple melodic line are emblematic of Brahms’ ability to convey deep emotion through economy of means. The piece is often used pedagogically to introduce young musicians to Romantic phrasing and expressive nuance.",
    "author_notes_source": "Oxford Companion to Music, 2002 Edition",
    "made_famous_by": "The melody has been widely used in music boxes, children's toys, and countless recordings, making it one of the most universally recognized lullabies.",
