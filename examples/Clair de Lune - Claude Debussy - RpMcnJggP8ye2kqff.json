    "title": "Clair de Lune",
    "composer": "Claude Debussy",
    "year": 1905,
    "musical_era": "Impressionism",
    "genre": "Solo piano",
    "historical_context": "Clair de Lune is the third movement of Debussy’s Suite bergamasque, a four-movement suite for solo piano. Though the suite was begun in 1890, Debussy revised and published it in 1905. The title 'Clair de Lune' (French for 'Moonlight') was inspired by Paul Verlaine’s poem of the same name, reflecting the Impressionist movement’s fascination with atmosphere, mood, and suggestion rather than direct expression.",
    "historical_anecdote": "Debussy originally titled the piece 'Promenade sentimentale' but later changed it to 'Clair de Lune' to align with Verlaine’s poem. The piece was composed during a period when Debussy was distancing himself from the Germanic traditions of form and harmonic development, favoring instead a more fluid and coloristic approach.",
    "historical_anecdote_source": "Nichols, Roger. Debussy: A Painter in Sound. Yale University Press, 2018.",
    "author_notes": "Clair de Lune is one of Debussy’s most beloved works, often used in film and media to evoke introspection and emotional depth. Its subtle harmonic shifts and delicate textures exemplify Debussy’s mastery of nuance and atmosphere.",

    "made_famous_by": "Widely popularized through performances by Walter Gieseking and later by Isao Tomita’s electronic arrangement, as well as its inclusion in films such as 'Ocean’s Eleven' and 'Twilight'.",
